# room4A

This is the repo behind [room4A](https://javahammes.github.io/room4A.dev/).

The blog is about whatever I find currently interesting and what I would like to share with others.

But you can expect kernel stuff, low-level programming, and maybe talks about retro tech at some point, who knows.

It's built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Typo theme](https://github.com/TechTac/typo).
