### Well, what should you know about me?

I'm from Earth.

I've never watched *The Simpsons* or *Family Guy*.

I drink way too much Coke Zero, and I **don't** enjoy playing video games.
The only game I'm actually eager to play is chess. Probably because I'm super competitive at everything I do.

Oh, and something interesting: my real name isn't actually *JavaHammes*.

I got that name back in school because I started coding when I was 12 and was already pretty good at *Java*. That’s where the "Java" part comes from.
*Hammes* is loosely based on my real last name, kind of a nickname twist. (Don’t ask me how exactly it evolved, even I’m not sure.)

**Enough said.**

Alright, here's a joke: *A dog walks into a bar, asks for a job. The bartender says "A talking dog, you should be in the circus!" The dog says "Why would a circus need a bartender?"*
