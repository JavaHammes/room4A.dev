I have to admit: I noticed all of my posts kept getting longer and longer, and I started getting bored reading them myself.

So this one is going to be short. But it carries an important message:

**AI = Compression.**

## The Hutter Prize

The goal? Compress a 1GB file (`enwik9`, the first 10⁹ bytes of English Wikipedia) as much as possible.
And for every **1% improvement**, you get **$5,000**.

The purpose of the [Hutter Prize](https://www.hutter1.net/) is to encourage research in artificial intelligence. The organizers believe that **text compression and AI are fundamentally the same problem**.

The idea is that compressing natural language requires understanding it, not just on a surface level, but in terms of structure, meaning, and context. To predict what comes next in a sentence, a compressor needs to "know" grammar, facts, and common sense. So in a way, better compression means better understanding, and that's exactly what AI is about.

Think you're up for the challenge? Good news: the contest is open-ended. Anyone can participate.

The current record was set on **September 3, 2024**, by Kaido Orav and Byron Knoll with their program [fx2-cmix](https://github.com/kaitz/fx2-cmix), achieving a compressed size of `~111 MB`.

While writing this, I thought: *Pff, that sounds easy.* But I’m guessing it probably isn’t.

I hope I could encourage you to try beating the challenge (I’ll definitely spend the next days digging into it. Maybe my next post will be about that. Who knows?).

And I hope I gave you a better mental model of what AI **really** is.

Hope you enjoyed this compressed post.
