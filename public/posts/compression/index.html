<p>The goal? Compress a 1GB file (<code>enwik9</code>, the first 10⁹ bytes of English Wikipedia) as much as possible.
And for every <strong>1% improvement</strong>, you get <strong>$5,000</strong>.</p>
<p>The purpose of the <a href="https://www.hutter1.net/">Hutter Prize</a> is to encourage research in artificial intelligence. The organizers believe that <strong>text compression and AI are fundamentally the same problem</strong>.</p>
<p>The idea is that compressing natural language requires understanding it, not just on a surface level, but in terms of structure, meaning, and context. To predict what comes next in a sentence, a compressor needs to &ldquo;know&rdquo; grammar, facts, and common sense. So in a way, better compression means better understanding, and that&rsquo;s exactly what AI is about.</p>
<p>Think you&rsquo;re up for the challenge? Good news: the contest is open-ended. Anyone can participate.</p>
<p>The current record was set on <strong>September 3, 2024</strong>, by Kaido Orav and Byron Knoll with their program <a href="https://github.com/kaitz/fx2-cmix">fx2-cmix</a>, achieving a compressed size of <code>~111 MB</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>While writing this, I thought: <em>Pff, that sounds easy.</em> But I’m guessing it probably isn’t.</p>
<p>I hope I could encourage you to try beating the challenge (I’ll definitely spend the next days digging into it. Maybe my next post will be about that. Who knows?).</p>
<p>And I hope I gave you a better mental model of what AI <strong>really</strong> is.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed this compressed post.</p>
